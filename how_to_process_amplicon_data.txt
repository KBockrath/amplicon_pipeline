# How to process amplicon data for Steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 outside of HTCondor DAG #
#################################################################################

# all of the step1, step2, step3, and step4 python/condor/shell/text files need to be in /home/smccalla (or your home directory i.e. /home/ylor)
# this is assuming that the data has already been through bcl2fastq
# the raw data is located at: /home/smccalla/working_docker_directory/raw_data

# start docker:
docker run -it -v /home/smccalla/:/home/smccalla/ -w /usr/ -i smccalla/amplicon_dockerfile /bin/bash

# change directory to the directory with the step1, 2, 3, and 4 python files:
# might not have to do this anymore since I added the steps to the docker file
cd /home/smccalla

# start qiime:
source activate qiime1

# install biopython package:
conda install -q -y biopython
pip2 install biopython
# Installing biopython can be complicated sometimes because there are 2 versions of python in the docker container:
# Python2 for Qiime1 and Python3 for conda. So you have to be specific *WHERE* (meaning python2 or python3) you want biopython installed.

# change bash prompt to shorten (just an option, not necessary)

# STEP 1

# This step copies the raw data files to the current working directory, executes fastQValidator, executes FastQC,
# executes trimmomatic, joins paired ends

# If you want to change the analysis to a different sample library, change the "GAIM_15" to your library of interest, 
# i.e. change to "GAIM_16" in the command line arguments.
# There are 7 elements you need to start Step1.
# 1. Invoke python: python 
# 2. Call the python script you want to run: step1.py 
# 3. All of the forward sequences you want to analyze. The "*" is a wildcard here that will match everything with this pattern: GAIM_15*_R1_001.fastq.gz
# 4. All of the reverse sequences you want to analyze. The "*" is a wildcard here that will match everything with this pattern: GAIM_15*_R2_001.fastq.gz
# 5. The name of the library: GAIM_15
# 6. NextSeq run name: 160408_NB501144_0002_AHMFMNBGXX
# 7. bcl2fastq project name: Loons_Long_Tailed
# Enter all of those elements (1-7) all at once at the command line.

# To execute step1:
python step1.py GAIM_15*_R1_001.fastq.gz GAIM_15*_R2_001.fastq.gz GAIM_15 160408_NB501144_0002_AHMFMNBGXX Loons_Long_Tailed

# This will create a folder in "GAIM_15" called "data". This will have folders within it "fastQC", "fastQValidator", "join_paired_ends", "trimdata"
# and the data folder will also have all of the transferred and unzipped data in it.

#_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# STEP 2

# This step converts fasta to fastq, changes the sequence names, assigns taxonomy #1, splits the data into many files

# ***Make sure you have a mapping file and/or that the mapping file is correct (i.e. change "GAIM_15" to "GAIM_16" 
#    in loon_qiime_mapping_file_trainer_file_3_corrected.txt)***
# If you want to change the analysis to a different sample library, change the "GAIM_15" to your library of interest, 
# i.e. change to "GAIM_16" in the command line arguments.
# There are 3 elements you need to start Step2:
# 1. Invoke python: python 
# 2. Call the python script you want to run: step1.py 
# 3. The name of the library: GAIM_15

# To execute step2:
python step2.py GAIM_15

# This will create folders and files in /home/smccalla/GAIM_15/data like fasta_files/fastqjoin.join.fna.formatted/.
# and the large fasta data file will be chunked into many smaller files for Step3.

# If you get the following error it means biopython is not installed:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "step2.py", line 192, in <module>
    record_iter = SeqIO.parse(open(newotupath),"fasta")
NameError: name 'SeqIO' is not defined

# If needed, within docker, change the permissions for all of the files you just made since docker operates as root.
# The "-R" means recursively, so it changes the permissions of not just "GAIM_15", but all of the subfolders and files:
chmod -R 777 /home/smccalla/GAIM_15

#_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# STEP 3

# This step BLASTS the fasta files

# Exit docker:
exit

# Or open a new terminal window to execute Step 3.

# Change directory to where your scripts are, if necessary:
cd /home/smccalla/

# Make a "log" folder  for the condor output file in "/home/smccalla/test_28" ---> "/home/smccalla/GAIM_15/log"
mkdir /home/smccalla/GAIM_15/log

# Change the library name in both the step3.sub and step3_outformat_6.sh files, i.e. change all instances of "GAIM_15" to "GAIM_16"

# Use HTCondor to BLAST the fasta files in /home/smccalla/test_28/data/fasta_files/fastqjoin.join.fna.formatted/group_*.fasta
# that were split up from the combined_seqs.fna file into many smaller files.
condor_submit step3.sub

# You'll get the following warning, but it's fine. It's just because there's a wildcard ("*") in the queue command:
# queue filename matching files /home/smccalla/GAIM_15/data/fasta_files/fastqjoin.join.fna.formatted/group_*.fasta
WARNING: the Queue variable 'filename' was unused by condor_submit. Is it a typo?

# Check the status of the BLAST jobs by:
condor_q

# If you want to remove/cancel your HTCondor jobs, just substitute "smccalla" with your user name:
condor_rm smccalla 

#_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# STEP 4

# This step concatenates the BLAST results, assigns taxonomy #2, summarizes taxa, and summarizes taxa through plots
# executes trimmomatic, joins paired ends

# start docker:
docker run -it -v /home/smccalla/:/home/smccalla/ -w /usr/ -i smccalla/amplicon_dockerfile /bin/bash

# change directory to the directory with the step1, 2, 3, and 4 python files:

# start qiime:

# Install the biopython package.
